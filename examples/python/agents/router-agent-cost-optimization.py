RouterAgent Cost Optimization Example

This example demonstrates how to use RouterAgent for intelligent model selection
based on cost optimization. The router agent automatically selects the most
cost-effective model for different types of tasks while maintaining quality.

Features demonstrated:
- Cost-optimized model routing
- Automatic model selection based on task complexity
- Usage tracking and cost monitoring
- Fallback mechanisms for reliability
