Basic Camera Integration Example

This example demonstrates how to capture a single frame from a camera
and analyze it using a PraisonAI vision agent.

Requirements:
    pip install praisonaiagents opencv-python

Usage:
    python camera-basic.py

Environment Variables:
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
