Multi-Agent Camera Analysis Example

This example demonstrates using multiple specialized agents to analyze
camera feeds from different perspectives (security, object detection, etc.).

Requirements:
    pip install praisonaiagents opencv-python

Usage:
    python camera-multi-agent.py

Environment Variables:
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
