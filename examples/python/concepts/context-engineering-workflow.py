Context Engineering Workflow - Advanced Multi-Agent Example

This example demonstrates advanced Context Engineering workflows using ContextAgent
in combination with other PraisonAI agents. It shows how Context Engineering can
dramatically improve AI implementation success rates through comprehensive context
generation and validation loops.

Workflow demonstrated:
1. Product Manager Agent defines requirements
2. ContextAgent analyzes codebase and generates comprehensive context
3. Architecture Agent designs implementation using context
4. Developer Agent implements using context-enhanced prompts
5. QA Agent validates using context-generated criteria

This represents the full Context Engineering methodology in action.
