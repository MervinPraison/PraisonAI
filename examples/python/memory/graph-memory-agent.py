Graph Memory Agent Example

This example demonstrates how to use Mem0's graph memory capabilities 
with PraisonAI agents to create and utilize complex relationships 
between pieces of information.

Requirements:
    pip install "praisonaiagents[graph]"

Setup:
    - For Neo4j: Set up a Neo4j instance (local or AuraDB)
    - For Memgraph: Run with Docker: 
      docker run -p 7687:7687 memgraph/memgraph-mage:latest --schema-info-enabled=True
