# Extended agents.yaml with Workflow Patterns
# This file demonstrates the extended agents.yaml format that supports
# advanced workflow patterns while maintaining backward compatibility.
#
# Usage: praisonai agents_workflow.yaml
#
# Key differences from standard agents.yaml:
# - process: workflow (triggers workflow mode)
# - workflow: section for planning, reasoning, memory
# - steps: section for workflow patterns (route, parallel, loop, repeat)

framework: praisonai
process: workflow
topic: "Research AI trends and create a comprehensive report"

# Workflow configuration (new)
workflow:
  planning: true
  reasoning: true
  verbose: true
  memory_config:
    provider: chroma
    persist: true

# Variables for template substitution
variables:
  topic: AI trends
  topics:
    - Machine Learning
    - Neural Networks
    - Natural Language Processing

# Agent definitions using familiar 'roles' format

# Workflow steps with patterns (new)
steps:
  # Step 1: Classify the request
  - agent: classifier
    action: "Classify this request: {{topic}}"
    
  # Step 2: Route to appropriate handler based on classification
  - name: routing
    route:
      technical: [tech_expert]
      creative: [creative_writer]
      default: [researcher]
      
  # Step 3: Parallel research on multiple aspects
  - name: parallel_research
    parallel:
      - agent: researcher
        action: "Research technology trends for {{topic}}"
      - agent: market_analyst
        action: "Analyze market opportunities for {{topic}}"
        
  # Step 4: Loop over specific topics
  - agent: researcher
    action: "Deep dive into {{item}}"
    loop:
      over: topics
      
  # Step 5: Aggregate all findings
  - agent: aggregator
    action: "Synthesize all research findings into a comprehensive report"
    repeat:
      until: "comprehensive"
