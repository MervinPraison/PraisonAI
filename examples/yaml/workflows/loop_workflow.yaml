description: An agent processes multiple items in a loop, then a summarizer combines results

workflow:
  verbose: true

variables:
  topics:
    - Artificial Intelligence
    - Machine Learning
    - Neural Networks
    - Natural Language Processing

agents:
  processor:
    name: Processor
    role: Topic Processor
    goal: Process and analyze each topic thoroughly
    instructions: |
      You are a topic processor. For each topic given, provide:
      1. A brief definition
      2. Key concepts
      3. Real-world applications
      Keep your response concise but informative.

  summarizer:
    name: Summarizer
    role: Results Summarizer
    goal: Summarize all processed results into a final report
    instructions: "You are a summarizer. Combine all the processed topics into a cohesive final report."

steps:
  - agent: processor
    action: "Analyze this topic: {{item}}"
    loop:
      over: topics
      
  - agent: summarizer
    action: "Create a comprehensive summary of all the analyzed topics based on these results: {{previous_output}}"
