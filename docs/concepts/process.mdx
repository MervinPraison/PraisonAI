# Understanding Process Types

Process types in PraisonAI define how tasks are executed and how agents collaborate. Each process type offers different patterns for task execution and agent coordination.

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Sequential Process

The simplest form of task execution where tasks are performed one after another.

<Card>
  ### Characteristics
  - Linear execution flow
  - Predictable order
  - Simple dependency management
  - Direct task progression

  ### Usage
  ```python
  agents = PraisonAIAgents(
      agents=[agent1, agent2],
      tasks=[task1, task2, task3],
      process="sequential"
  )
  ```
</Card>

## Hierarchical Process

Uses a manager agent to coordinate task execution and agent assignments.

<Card>
  ### Characteristics
  - Manager-driven coordination
  - Dynamic task assignment
  - Flexible execution order
  - Intelligent resource allocation

  ### Configuration
  ```python
  agents = PraisonAIAgents(
      agents=[manager_agent, worker_agent1, worker_agent2],
      tasks=[task1, task2],
      process="hierarchical",
      manager_llm="gpt-4o"
  )
  ```
</Card>

## Workflow Process

Advanced process type supporting complex task relationships and conditional execution.

<Card>
  ### Features
  - Task dependencies
  - Conditional branching
  - Loop handling
  - Context sharing
  - State management

  ### Implementation
  ```python
  task_workflow = {
      "start_task": {
          "next": ["decision_task"],
          "type": "task"
      },
      "decision_task": {
          "type": "decision",
          "conditions": {
              "success": ["process_task"],
              "failure": ["error_task"]
          }
      }
  }
  ```
</Card>

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install PraisonAI">
    Install the core package:
    ```bash Terminal
    pip install praisonaiagents
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Environment">
    ```bash Terminal
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
    ```
    Generate your OpenAI API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
    Use other LLM providers like Ollama, Anthropic, Groq, Google, etc. Please refer to the [Models](/models) for more information.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Agent">
    Create `app.py`:
<CodeGroup>
  ```python Single Agent Sequential Process
  from praisonaiagents import Agent, Task, PraisonAIAgents

  # Create an agent
  researcher = Agent(
      name="Researcher",
      role="Senior Research Analyst",
      goal="Uncover cutting-edge developments in AI",
      backstory="You are an expert at a technology research group",
      verbose=True,
      llm="gpt-4o"
  )

  # Define a task
  task = Task(
      name="research_task",
      description="Analyze 2024's AI advancements",
      expected_output="A detailed report",
      agent=researcher
  )

  # Run the agents
  agents = PraisonAIAgents(
      agents=[researcher],
      tasks=[task],
      verbose=False,
      process="sequential"
  )

  result = agents.start()
  ```

  ```python Multiple Agents Hierarchical Process
  from praisonaiagents import Agent, Task, PraisonAIAgents

  # Create multiple agents 
  researcher = Agent(
      name="Researcher",
      role="Senior Research Analyst",
      goal="Uncover cutting-edge developments in AI",
      backstory="You are an expert at a technology research group",
      verbose=True,
      llm="gpt-4o",
      markdown=True
  )

  writer = Agent(
      name="Writer",
      role="Tech Content Strategist",
      goal="Craft compelling content on tech advancements",
      backstory="You are a content strategist",
      llm="gpt-4o",
      markdown=True
  )

  # Define multiple tasks
  task1 = Task(
      name="research_task",
      description="Analyze 2024's AI advancements",
      expected_output="A detailed report",
      agent=researcher
  )

  task2 = Task(
      name="writing_task",
      description="Create a blog post about AI advancements",
      expected_output="A blog post",
      agent=writer
  )

  # Run with hierarchical process
  agents = PraisonAIAgents(
      agents=[researcher, writer],
      tasks=[task1, task2],
      verbose=False,
      process="hierarchical",
      manager_llm="gpt-4o"
  )

  result = agents.start()
  ```
