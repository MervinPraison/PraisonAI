# PraisonAI Course Content Plan

This file summarizes the modules already available in `docs/pt-br` and highlights topics that can still be developed. Use it as a guide to track the progress of the material.

## Current Content

   - What PraisonAI is, philosophy and use cases.
   - Learning methodology based on the scientific cycle.
2. **Installation**
   - Complete installation guide on Windows with environment variables and package verification.
3. **Fundamental Concepts**
   - Explanation about agents, tasks, tools, processes, memory and RAG.
4. **Using PraisonAI**
   - Usage with Python (`praisonaiagents`).
   - Usage with YAML (CLI `praisonai`).
   - Usage with JavaScript/TypeScript.
   - Quick guide "Creating Your First Agent".
   - Catalogue of agent models available in the examples.
   - YAML configuration to define agents declaratively.
   - Imports and essential functions for creating agents.
5. **Advanced Workflows**
   - Collaboration between agents, routing, orchestration, autonomous mode, parallelization and prompt chaining.
6. **Tools**
   - Overview and creation of custom tools.
7. **LLM Models**
   - Configuration of different providers (OpenAI, Ollama, Groq, etc.).
8. **Practical Examples**
   - Case studies demonstrating real applications of the framework.
9. **Contributing and Development**
   - Steps to work locally and contribute to the project.
   - Understanding the code structure in `src/`.
10. **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**
    - Quick answers for common installation and runtime errors.

## Points to Develop

- Add installation instructions for Linux and macOS.
- Explore more detailed examples of advanced tools and memories.
- Create additional practical exercises to reinforce the concepts.
- Document specific integrations with other LLM providers (e.g., Gemini, Anthropic).
- Include a debugging guide and best practices for troubleshooting.
- Create sections for features not yet documented:
   - (done) Multimodal Agents
   - (done) Code Interpreter Agents
   - (done) Math Agents
   - (done) Agents with Structured Output
   - (done) Callback Agents
   - (done) Mini AI Agents
- Document the code structure and YAML examples (done)

This plan should be updated whenever new modules or sections are created.
