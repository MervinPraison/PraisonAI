### Configuration Options

```python
# Create an agent with reasoning configuration
agent = Agent(
    role="Problem Solver",
    goal="Solve complex problems",
    backstory="Expert in problem-solving",
    tools=[Tools.internet_search],
    verbose=True,  # Enable detailed logging
    llm="gpt-4o"  # Language model to use
)

# Task with reasoning requirements
task = Task(
    description="Solve complex problem",
    expected_output="Detailed solution",
    agent=agent
)
```

## Troubleshooting

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Reasoning Errors" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    If reasoning seems incorrect:
    - Check problem description clarity
    - Enable verbose mode for debugging
    - Review agent configuration
  </Card>

  <Card title="Process Flow" icon="code">
    If process flow is unclear:
    - Verify task dependencies
    - Check agent roles and goals
    - Review task descriptions
