PraisonAI Code helps you to interact with your whole codebase using the power of AI.

## Different User Interfaces:

| Interface | Description | URL |
|---|---|---|
| **UI** | Multi Agents such as CrewAI or AutoGen | [https://docs.praison.ai/ui/ui](https://docs.praison.ai/ui/ui) |
| **Chat** | Chat with 100+ LLMs, single AI Agent | [https://docs.praison.ai/ui/chat](https://docs.praison.ai/ui/chat) |
| **Code** | Chat with entire Codebase, single AI Agent | [https://docs.praison.ai/ui/code](https://docs.praison.ai/ui/code) |

## Install PraisonAI Code

1. 
```bash
pip install "praisonai[code]"
```

2. 
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=xxxxxxxx
```

3. 
```bash
praisonai code
```

4. Username and Password will be asked for the first time. `admin` is the default username and password.

5. Set Model name to be gpt-4o-mini in the settings 


## Other Models

* Use 100+ LLMs - [Litellm](https://litellm.vercel.app/docs/providers)
* Includes Gemini 1.5 for 2 Million Context Length

## To Use Gemini 1.5

* ```export GEMINI_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxx```
* ```praisonai code```
* Set Model name to be ```gemini/gemini-1.5-flash``` in the settings

## Ignore Files

### Using .praisonignore

* Create a `.praisonignore` file in the root folder of the project
* Add files to ignore

```bash
.*
*.pyc
pycache
.git
.gitignore
.vscode
.idea
.DS_Store
.lock
.pyc
.env
```

### Using settings.yaml 
(.praisonignore is preferred)

* Create a `settings.yaml` file in the root folder of the project
* Add below Variables and required Ignore Files

```yaml
code:
  ignore_files:
  - ".*"
  - "*.pyc"
  - "pycache"
  - ".git"
  - ".gitignore"
  - ".vscode"
  - ".idea"
  - ".DS_Store"
  - ".lock"
  - ".pyc"
  - ".env"
```

### Using .env File

* Create a `.env` file in the root folder of the project
* Add below Variables and required Ignore Files

```bash
PRAISONAI_IGNORE_FILES=".*,*.pyc,__pycache__,.git,.gitignore,.vscode"
```

### Using Environment Variables in the Terminal

```bash
export PRAISONAI_IGNORE_FILES=".*,*.pyc,__pycache__,.git,.gitignore,.vscode"
```

## Include Files .praisoninclude

- Add files you wish to Include files in the context
- This will include the files/folders mentioned in `.praisoninclude` to the original context (files in the folder - .gitignore  - .praisonignore)

* Create a `.praisoninclude` file in the root folder of the project
* Add files to Include

```bash
projectfiles
docs
```

## Include ONLY these Files .praisoncontext (Context)

- Add files you wish to Include files in the context
- This will include ONLY the files/folders mentioned in `.praisoncontext` to the context

* Create a `.praisoncontext` file in the root folder of the project
* Add files to Include

```bash
projectfiles
docs
```

## Set Max Tokens

Note: By Default Max Tokens set is 900,000

```bash
export PRAISONAI_MAX_TOKENS=1000000
```

or 

* Create a .env file in the root folder of the project
* Add below Variables and required Max Tokens
* ```
  PRAISONAI_MAX_TOKENS=1000000
  ```

## Default DB Location

`~/.praison/database.sqlite`

## Key Features

### Internet Search

PraisonAI Code now includes internet search capabilities using Crawl4AI and Tavily. This feature allows you to retrieve up-to-date information and code snippets during your coding sessions, enhancing your ability to find relevant programming information and examples.

To use this feature:
1. Ask a question or request information about a specific coding topic
2. The AI will use internet search to find the most relevant and current information
3. You'll receive code snippets, documentation references, or explanations based on the latest available resources

### Vision Language Model (VLM) Support

While primarily designed for code interactions, PraisonAI Code also supports Vision Language Model capabilities. This feature can be particularly useful when dealing with visual aspects of programming, such as UI design, data visualization, or understanding code structure through diagrams.

To use this feature:
1. Upload an image related to your coding query (e.g., a screenshot of a UI, a flowchart, or a code snippet image)
2. Ask questions or request analysis based on the uploaded image
3. The VLM will process the image and provide insights or answers based on its visual content, helping you understand or implement the visual concepts in your code

These new features significantly expand the capabilities of PraisonAI Code, allowing for more comprehensive and up-to-date coding assistance.

## Local Docker Development with Live Reload

To facilitate local development with live reload, you can use Docker. Follow the steps below:

1. **Create a `Dockerfile.dev`**:
    ```dockerfile
    FROM python:3.11-slim

    WORKDIR /app

    COPY . .

    RUN pip install flask praisonai==2.0.18 watchdog

    EXPOSE 5555

    ENV FLASK_ENV=development

    CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
    ```

2. **Create a `docker-compose.yml`**:
    ```yaml
    version: '3.8'

    services:
      app:
        build:
          context: .
          dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
        volumes:
          - .:/app
        ports:
          - "5555:5555"
        environment:
          FLASK_ENV: development
        command: flask run --host=0.0.0.0

      watch:
        image: alpine:latest
        volumes:
          - .:/app
        command: sh -c "apk add --no-cache inotify-tools && while inotifywait -r -e modify,create,delete /app; do kill -HUP 1; done"
    ```

3. **Run Docker Compose**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

This setup will allow you to develop locally with live reload, making it easier to test and iterate on your code.
