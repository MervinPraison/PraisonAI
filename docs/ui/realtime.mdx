## Features

- Real-time voice input processing
- Text-to-speech output for AI responses
- Seamless integration with OpenAI's realtime API (including Azure OpenAI)
- Support for various AI models
- Persistent conversation history
- Financial data integration with yfinance

## Getting Started

To use the Realtime Voice Interface, follow these steps:

1. Install PraisonAI with the realtime dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install "praisonai[realtime]"
   ```

2. Set up your OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

   **For Azure OpenAI users:**
   ```bash
   export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://your-resource.openai.azure.com"
   export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="your-azure-api-key"
   export AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION="2024-02-15-preview"
   ```

3. Launch the Realtime Voice Interface:
   ```bash
   praisonai realtime
   ```

## Usage

Once the interface is launched:

1. Click the microphone button or press 'P' to start voice input.
2. Speak your message or query.
3. The AI will process your input and respond with both text and voice.
4. You can ask for financial data, which will be fetched using yfinance.
5. The conversation history is maintained for context in ongoing discussions.

## Configuration

You can configure various aspects of the Realtime Voice Interface:

- Model selection: Choose different AI models for processing.
- Voice settings: Adjust voice characteristics for the AI's speech output.
- Audio settings: Configure input/output audio formats and quality.

### Azure OpenAI Configuration

To use Azure OpenAI instead of standard OpenAI, set these environment variables:

| Environment Variable | Description | Required |
|---------------------|-------------|----------|
| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` | Your Azure OpenAI endpoint URL | Yes |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your Azure OpenAI API key | Yes |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` | API version (default: 2024-02-15-preview) | No |

Example:
```bash
export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://your-resource.openai.azure.com"
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="your-azure-api-key"
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION="2024-02-15-preview"
```

When these variables are set, PraisonAI will automatically use Azure OpenAI for both the realtime API and image generation features.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Ensure your microphone is properly connected and permitted in your browser.
- Check your internet connection for stable real-time communication.
- Verify that your OpenAI API key is correctly set and has the necessary permissions.
