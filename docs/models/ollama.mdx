  <Accordion title="Ollama Integration" defaultOpen>
    **Standard OpenAI SDK Environment Variables (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
    export MODEL_NAME=deepseek-r1:14b
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=NA
    ```
    
    **Alternative Environment Variable Patterns:**
    ```bash
    # Community recommended pattern
    export OLLAMA_API_BASE=http://localhost:11434
    export MODEL_NAME=gemma3:4b
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=fake-key
    
    # Legacy pattern (still supported)
    export OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:11434/v1
    export OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=llama2
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=not-needed
    ```
    
    **Usage with praisonai --init:**
    ```bash
    # Make sure Ollama is running
    ollama serve
    
    # Pull your desired model
    ollama pull deepseek-r1:14b
    
    # Set environment variables
    export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
    export MODEL_NAME=deepseek-r1:14b
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=NA
    
    # Initialize agents
    praisonai --init "Create a story about AI"
    ```
