"""
Demonstration of the sequential tool calling fix for Issue #824.

This script shows how the fixed implementation allows the LLM to:
1. Call the first tool (get_stock_price)
2. Receive the result 
3. Use that result to call the second tool (multiply)
4. Return a final response incorporating both results

Before the fix: Only the first tool would be called and its result returned directly.
After the fix: Both tools are called sequentially as intended.
