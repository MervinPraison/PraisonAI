## Patch: Force SQLite for PraisonAI

**File:** `praisonai/ui/db.py`  
**Purpose:** Prevent PraisonAI from connecting to Supabase/Postgres when a `.env` file contains conflicting database configurations. Forces usage of SQLite.

### Applying the Patch
1. Navigate to your virtual environment site-packages folder:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/venvPraison/lib/python3.11/site-packages/

   1. codePatches/praisonai/ui/db.py
- fixes error where praisonAi tries to gain access to supabase or postgres isntance of production code. this is disallowed because of a table conflict in the [users] table where an either or relationship is caused by conflict schema between the two applications prismScape and praisonAi

[devNotes]:
# a centralized file or usage of this at a config level would be ideal to allow users to turn on or off auto detection of the local dbs.
