### Example Usage

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent, Task, PraisonAIAgents

# Create an agent with a custom tool
def calculator(expression: str) -> str:
    return f"Result: {eval(expression)}"

agent = Agent(
    name="MathAgent",
    instructions="You are a helpful math assistant",
    tools=[calculator]
)

# Create a task
task = Task(
    name="calculate",
    description="Calculate 15 + 27 * 3",
    expected_output="The numerical result",
    agent=agent
)

# Create workflow
workflow = PraisonAIAgents(
    agents=[agent],
    tasks=[task],
    process="sequential"
)

# Ready to use with LLM providers
```

### Next Steps

1. **Set up API keys** for your preferred LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
2. **Run example files** to test with actual LLM providers
3. **Explore advanced features** like memory, knowledge, and MCP integration

### Example Commands

```bash
# Basic agent example
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
python basic-agents.py

# Agent with tools example
python basic-agents-tools.py

# Math agent example
python examples/python/agents/math-agent.py
```

### Test Files Created

During testing, the following verification files were created:
- `test_installation.py` - Basic installation verification
- `test_example_basic.py` - Example files functionality test
- `comprehensive_test.py` - Comprehensive functionality test
- `test_basic_functionality.py` - Core functionality testing
