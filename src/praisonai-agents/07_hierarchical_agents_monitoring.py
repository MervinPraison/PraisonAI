"""
Hierarchical Agents with Performance Monitoring - Example 7

Demonstrates performance monitoring for hierarchical agent systems:
- Manager-worker agent relationships
- Task delegation timing
- Hierarchical decision making performance
- Cross-level communication monitoring

Shows how to monitor complex organizational agent structures.
