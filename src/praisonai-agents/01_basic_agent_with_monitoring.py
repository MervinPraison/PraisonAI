"""
Basic Agent with Performance Monitoring - Example 1

Simple agent demonstrating performance monitoring basics:
- Function execution timing with @monitor_function decorator
- API call tracking with track_api_call context manager
- Basic performance statistics retrieval

This example shows the fundamental pattern for adding performance monitoring
to any PraisonAI agent workflow.
