Tilly pondered, her mind whirring, and soon the answer came to her. The friends cheered as Gizmo nodded in approval. Just then, Flora the Fox, sly and clever, appeared and offered her help. \"Only if you can outsmart me in a game of wits,\" she challenged.

Laughter filled the air as the friends performed the goofy tasks, their spirits high. Maya the Mouse, small but brave, snuck past the monkeys, cleverly avoiding their gaze.
