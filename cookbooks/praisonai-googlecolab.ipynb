Here is a summarized report on some of the notable exoplanet discoveries, highlighting their size, potential habitability, and distance from Earth:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Kepler-452b**\n",
            "   - **Size:** Approximately 60% larger in diameter than Earth.\n",
            "   - **Potential Habitability:** Often referred to as \"Earth's Cousin,\" Kepler-452b orbits within the habitable zone of its star, where liquid water could exist. The planet receives a similar amount of energy from its star as Earth does from the Sun.\n",
            "   - **Distance from Earth:** About 1,402 light-years.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Proxima Centauri b**\n",
            "   - **Size:** Slightly larger than Earth, with a minimum mass of 1.17 Earth masses.\n",
            "   - **Potential Habitability:** Located in the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri, the closest known star to the Sun. Potential for liquid water exists, but its habitability is uncertain due to stellar flare activity.\n",
            "   - **Distance from Earth:** 4.24 light-years.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **TRAPPIST-1 System**\n",
            "   - **Size:** The system contains seven Earth-sized planets. TRAPPIST-1e, f, and g are within the star's habitable zone.\n",
            "   - **Potential Habitability:** TRAPPIST-1e is considered the most promising candidate for habitability, as it has a rocky composition and is located in the middle of the habitable zone.\n",
            "   - **Distance from Earth:** About 39 light-years.\n",

            "   - **Distance from Earth:** Approximately 42 light-years.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Ross 128 b**\n",
